1 : SASA_1.4A_calculations.py
	Python script that includes the filtering steps of simulated structures, based on the geometric ranges defined by density maps. For each ensemble of filtered structures, the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) is calculated (probe size 1.4 Angstroms). 

2 : SASA_1.4A_calculations_plot_only.py
	This script will use the metadata (.pkl) files generated by SASA_1.4A_calculations.py in order to re-create SASA distribution plots.

3 : AbASA_7.2A_calculations.py
	Python script for structural filtering and Antibody Accessible Surface Area (AbASA) calculation (probe size 7.2 Angstroms)

4 : AbASA_7.2A_calculations_plot_only.py
	This script will use the metadata (.pkl) files generated by AbASA_7.2A_calculations.py in order to re-create AbASA distribution plots. 

5 : AbASA_18.6A_calculations.py
	Python script for structural filtering and Antibody Accessible Surface Area (AbASA) calculation (probe size 18.6 Angstroms). 

6 : AbASA_18.6A_calculations_in_parts1.py and AbASA_18.6A_calculations_in_parts2.py
	These scripts perform the same calculation as AbASA_18.6A_calculation.py.  However, the _part2 script allows for one to distribute the calculation across many independent nodes/resources. This is necessary when analyzing every frame of the full dataset (1000 trajectories), which could take weeks on a single core.

7 : AbASA_18.6A_calculations_in_parts_plot.py
	This will take the metadata (.pkl) files generated by AbASA_18.6A_calculations_in_parts1.py and AbASA_18.6A_calculations_in_parts2.py to produce the plots of AbASA distributions. 

8 : analysis_for_trajectories_with_force.py
	Python script with the analysis of the simulations with and without the CV3-25 antibody

USING THESE SCRIPTS
----------------------------

To run this analysis, you should download the set of simulated trajectories that are described in Dodero-Rojas, Onuchic and Whitford, eLife, 2021 and Grunst et al, Science, 2024. The data directory may be downloaded from DRYAD(DOI: 10.5061/dryad.ncjsxkt3h).
  
After downloading the full set of data (directory SpikeSimData), run this script from within SpikeSimData, using the command: python <script name>
