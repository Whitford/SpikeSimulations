This directory contains the inputs to generate simulations of pre-to-postfusion transitions published in Dodero-Rojas et al, eLife, 2021. For questions about the model (SMOG model) and software (SMOG 2 and OpenSMOG), more information is available at smog-server.org

In this study, we used an unofficial customized version of Gromacs, which is provided here. However, we have since ported the models to OpenSMOG/OpenMM and the new input decks will be made available soon.

example.slurm: Simulation submission sample script

resub.slurm: Follow up simulation submission sample script

gromacs_flat_GR: Modified version of Gromacs including the flat bottom potential implemented in the Dodero-Rojas et al, eLife, 2021 simulations

base.mdp: Production MDP Gromacs setting file
 
index.ndx: Index of relevant groups of the simulated system

moveable_host_membrane.gro: Input structure with a z-position tag at the FP used to set up the virtual host membrane potential

postfusion_with_glycans_pre_TM.top: Input topology file
