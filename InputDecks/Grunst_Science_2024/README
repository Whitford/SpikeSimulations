This directory contains the inputs to generate simulations of pre-to-postfusion transitions with and without CV3-25 AB in the presence of force. For questions about the model (SMOG model) and software (SMOG 2 and OpenSMOG), more information is available at smog-server.org

sim_pull_withCV3.py: Simulation script for the pre-to-post transition with an applied force
force and CV3-25 Ab present.
    The following packages are required: OpenSMOG, OpenMM, mdtraj, numpy, and sys.
    To run the simulation:
        python sim_pull_withCV3.py <ID> <Force> 
    <ID> is an arbitrary integer that you can assign to keep track of your runs.
    <Force> is the applied force, in units of pN

sim_pull_withoutCV3.py: Simulation script of the pre-to-post transition with force.
    The following packages are required: OpenSMOG, OpenMM, mdtraj, numpy, and sys.
    To run the simulation:
        python sim_pull_withoutCV3.py <ID> <Force>
    <ID> is an arbitrary integer that you can assign to keep track of your runs.
    <Force> is the applied force, in units of pN
