# SpikeSimulations
This contains input decks and analysis scripts for simulating the SARS-CoV2-2 Spike protein using structure-based (SMOG) models.  For more information about the models, consult the original references and https://smog-server.org. This code is associated with the following DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.11081576

The directory "InputDecks" contains the files needed to run a simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, including the force field files, settings files and launch scripts.

The directory "Analysis" contains analysis tools that have been used in publications. This is currently empty, but we will release new tools soon.
